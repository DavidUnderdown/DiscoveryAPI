# DiscoveryAPI
Python script(s) for accessing The National Archives' Discovery API for obtaining and processing catalogue data programmatically.  Use the Sandbox, http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/API/sandbox/index, for initial exploration of API functionality, and example API calls with parameters, the script(s) here then each demonstrate the use of one end point (the script name should make it clear which).

The [API help pages](http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/API/Help) also give more information on using the API and the form taken by the output.

See Richard Dunley's blog posts on using the catalogue as data: [Catalogue as Data: the basics](http://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/catalogue-data-basics/) and [Catalogue as Data: the Prize Papers from the 2nd Anglo-Dutch War](http://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/catalogue-data-prize-papers-2nd-anglo-dutch-war/) and Sonia Ranade's about [Modelling our digital data](http://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/modelling-digital-archival-data/) to understand the inspriation for the creation of these scripts.  I felt it would help people ask for new things if they ahd a bit more understanding as to what was already possible.
